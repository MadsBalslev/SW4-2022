# 4th Semester project, BSc Software AAU

### Purpose
That the student learns how to design and implement a programming language and how this process can be supported by formal definitions of the language's syntax and semantics and techniques and methods for translator and / or interpreter construction.

### Reason
All software is written in a programming language and is translated or interpreted in order to be executed. Design, description and construction of Programming languages, translators, interpreters and similar tools are therefore central topics in computer science.

Therefore, the project work focuses on ensuring that the students understand important underlying concepts in the world of programming languages, why these concepts have arisen and how they are formally described and represented in an implementation. Understanding these topics is fundamental in understanding new and existing programming languages and their applications.

Furthermore, many techniques and tools, originally developed for languages and translators, are also used in other contexts in program development.
